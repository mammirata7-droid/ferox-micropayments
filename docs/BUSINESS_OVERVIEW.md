# Ferox Micropayments — Business Overview

## What Is Ferox?

Ferox is a **micropayment API** that lets AI agents pay for services in real time using Bitcoin’s Lightning Network. It connects AI-driven workflows with a payment layer so developers and businesses can monetize AI interactions in small, per-use amounts.

## Value Proposition

| For Whom | Value |
|----------|--------|
| **Developers** | Simple API to accept micropayments from AI agents without building payment infrastructure |
| **AI Agent Builders** | Standard way to pay for APIs, tools, and services as agents use them |
| **Service Providers** | New revenue stream from AI usage, paid in satoshis (1 sat ≈ $0.0004) |

---

## Business Model

Ferox is an **infrastructure layer**:

- **Free / open source** — Core API is available for self-hosting
- **Monetization options** — Hosted service, usage-based fees, or enterprise support
- **Lightning Network** — Low fees, instant settlement, global reach

---

## Target Markets

1. **AI Agent Platforms** — Platforms that run autonomous agents and need to pay for external APIs
2. **API Providers** — Services that want to charge per call instead of flat subscriptions
3. **AI Tool Builders** — Developers of tools (RAG, code gen, etc.) who want pay-per-use
4. **Research & Experimentation** — Labs testing agent economies and micropayment flows

---

## Key Differentiators

- **Lightning-first** — Built for micropayments (1–1M sats), not legacy card rails
- **Agent-oriented** — Designed for programmatic clients (AI agents), not humans
- **Minimal setup** — Deploy in minutes; optional LNbits for real Lightning
- **Self-hostable** — Full control over data and payment flow

---

## Revenue Streams (Potential)

| Stream | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| Hosted API | SaaS tier for teams that don’t want to self-host |
| Transaction fee | Small % or fixed fee per payment |
| Enterprise | Custom deployment, SLAs, support |
| Consulting | Integration and Lightning setup for businesses |

---

## Competitive Landscape

- **Stripe, PayPal** — Card-based, higher minimums, not built for agents
- **Lightning wallets** — User-focused, not API-first
- **Other agent payment projects** — Early stage; Ferox focuses on simplicity and deployability

---

## Go-to-Market

1. **Developer adoption** — Docs, examples, integrations with popular agent frameworks
2. **Community** — Open source, GitHub, Lightning/bitcoin communities
3. **Partnerships** — LNbits, agent platforms, API marketplaces
4. **Content** — Blog posts, demos, “AI pays you” use cases
